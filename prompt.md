Your task is to convert this working app of an image generator frontend querying a backend into a deno server using the Hono library that first builds the static frontend (I think I already did this for you via scirpt in the @deno.json , but feel free to check again) and then serves the `frontend./dist` folder staticallly. it should convert any calls to the gemini api services folder into API routes on the hono server. basically, convert this app to be a fullstack traditional app where the frontend queries the backend via API routes isntead of the weird google ai studio stack thing they have going on.
